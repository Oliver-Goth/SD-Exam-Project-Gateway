## Software Quality Exam - MTOGO Application 

MTOGO Software Solutions develops, tests, and maintains all software entirely in-house to ensure full control over quality, performance, security, and maintainability.
Documents containing the Test Strategy, Test Design, and two separate Test Plans for both the Legacy Monolithic System and the new Microservice Platform of the MTOGO application can be found in this repository.
Both systems share the same business goals, but they are different in architecture and testing focus:

•	Legacy Monolithic System:
 Legacy system: is tested to find weaknesses, improve stability, and prepare for migration to the new microservice system.
•	Microservice Platform:
 Designed for scalability, automation, and continuous testing through CI/CD pipelines.

This document demonstrates how a single in-house Software Quality Assurance (SQA) framework can be applied to different architectures while maintaining consistent quality standards.
Regular checkpoints, automated tests, and review meetings ensure that changes are verified before release and that no new issues are introduced.
By using multiple testing strategies and tracking metrics like coverage, defect density, and response time, the team maintains transparency and control over software quality.
This structured SQA process helps reduce long-term maintenance costs, increase reliability, and support continuous improvement for both the legacy and microservice systems.
